# React Native Mange Viewer

## About

Welcome to MangaViewer, your go-to app for accessing free manga pages provided by [MangaDex](https://mangadex.org/).

MangaViewer is a mobile application built using React Native, designed to provide users with a seamless experience for reading manga on the go.

Interested in how MangaViewer was built? You can find the complete source code for this application on GitHub. Feel free to explore, contribute, or fork the repository at [https://github.com/krasnoff/MangaViewer/](https://github.com/krasnoff/MangaViewer/).

MangaViewer was developed by Kobi Krasnoff. You can learn more about me and my other projects on my personal website: [https://krasnoff-personal-web-app.vercel.app/](https://krasnoff-personal-web-app.vercel.app/).


## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
